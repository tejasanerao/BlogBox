Tomghost is an easy level TryHackMe machine. It's created by [@stuxnet](https://tryhackme.com/p/stuxnet)

## Overview:
Nmap Scan, Apache Tomcat, SSH, PGP, and Privilege Escalation.

## Enumeration:
I started with typical Nmap port scanning.
```shell
nmap -sV -v -p- 10.10.10.10
```

<br>

As you can see have 22, 8009, and 8080 ports open which are our interest.

The system is running Apache Tomcat version 9.0.30. Also we have Apache Jserv(ajp13 service) on port 8009.

I looked through the webpage in browser and I got nothing which was useful. The Manager login is restricted. Then I googled “Tomcat ajp13 exploit” and the common term I could see was ‘Ghostcat’. I realized that the Tomcat version 9.0.30 is vulnerable this. But the most confusing part was there were several exploits for this vulnerability. It took me 10 mins to find the one which worked for me.

Go to this link and git clone the repository: [https://github.com/00theway/Ghostcat-CNVD-2020-10487](https://github.com/00theway/Ghostcat-CNVD-2020-10487)

<br>

```python
python3 ajpShooter.py http://<ip>:8080 8009 /WEB-INF/web.xml read
```

Execute the command and in the result you will get the ssh credentials for user ‘skyfuck’.

<br>

Login with SSH. You will see two files in the user directory of the user.

<br>

<br>

One is PGP file with some encrypted content and second one is the PGP private key. Luckily I knew about PGP encryption and knew what to do. Copy both the files to your local machine using scp command.
```ssh
scp skyfuck@<ip>:/home/skyfuck/* .
```

Above command will copy both the files at the same time to your current directory on local machine.

<br>

Also you will get the user flag in other user’s directory.

<br>

Back to PGP now. To decrypt the PGP file with the key, first we need to crack the passphrase that protects the key. I used gpg2john command to convert the key into its hash. And then crack the hash using john command.
```shell
gpg2john tryhackme.asc > hash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=gpg hash
```

<br>

<br>

You will get the passphrase. Now let’s decrypt the file. First I imported the key using gpg command. You will asked to enter the passphrase when you will execute the command. Once the key is imported, decrypt the file.
```shell
gpg --import tryhackme.asc
gpg --decrypt credential.pgp
```

<br>

<br>

You will get the password for the other user. Switch the user.
```shell
su merlin
```

After getting any low privileged user’s shell, first thing I always check the sudo permissions the user possesses. Again luckily it was all I needed to do.

<br>
![Image]({{ "/assets/images/thm/tomghost/sudol.png" | relative_url}})
<br>

merlin has sudo privileges to run /usr/bin/zip command. Whenever I get find a sudo permission for a program, I go to GTFOBins and surely everyone does the same if they are not sure about how to escalate privileges using a specific command.

Change the directory. Run the following command and you will be root.
```shell
touch hello
sudo zip hello /etc/hosts -T -TT 'sh #'
```

Get the Root Flag.

That's it for this machine. See you later!
